## Artificial Neural Network with Tensorflow &amp; Keras:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains.

 - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
 - Parts of Artificial Neural Networks
 - ANN Activity Functions
 - Feed Forward ANN
 - Back Forward ANN
 - Artificial Neural Networks Model
 - Sigmoid Neuron
 - Single Cell Perceptron Model
 - Multi  Layer Perceptron Model
 - Error Function
 - Gradient Descent
 - Stochastic Gradient Descent
 - Epoch
 - Cross Entropy Error Function (Classification)
 - Forward Progation
 - Back    Progation
 - Tensorflow
 - Keras
 - ANN Architectures using Functional API

 
 ## Projects using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
 - HandWritten Digit Recognition using ANN
 - Build an ANN Regression Model to predict the Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant

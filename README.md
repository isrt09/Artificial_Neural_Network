## Artificial Neural Network with Tensorflow &amp; Keras:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains.

 - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
 - Parts of Artificial Neural Networks
 - ANN Activity Functions
 - Feed Forward ANN
 - Back Forward ANN
 - Artificial Neural Networks Model
 - Single Layer Perceptron Model
 - Multi  Layer Perceptron Model
 
 ## Projects using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
 - HandWritten Digit Recognition using ANN
 - Build an ANN Regression Model to predict the Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant
